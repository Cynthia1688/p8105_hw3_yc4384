## Problem_1

**1. Importing Data**

    ##  [1] "order_id"               "product_id"             "add_to_cart_order"     
    ##  [4] "reordered"              "user_id"                "eval_set"              
    ##  [7] "order_number"           "order_dow"              "order_hour_of_day"     
    ## [10] "days_since_prior_order" "product_name"           "aisle_id"              
    ## [13] "department_id"          "aisle"                  "department"

**2. Data Description**

- The dataset **instacart** is a 1384617 \* 15 dataframe. It contains
  1384617 observations and key variables are: order_number, order_dow,
  order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order, product_name, aisle_id,
  department_id, aisle, department. Dataset has the order records of
  each costumers, including *product name, order number, user id*, etc.

- There are **134** aisles, and **fresh vegetables** aisles are the most
  items ordered from.

``` r
instacart |> 
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  summarize(n = n()) |> 
  count()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##       n
    ##   <int>
    ## 1   134

``` r
instacart |> 
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(n = n()) |> 
  mutate(n_ranking = min_rank(n)) |> 
  filter(n_ranking>133) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   aisle                 n n_ranking
    ##   <chr>             <int>     <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables 150609       134

- This plot shows **the number of items ordered in each aisle**, with
  limitation that to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered.

``` r
instacart |> 
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(n = n()) |> 
  mutate(n_ranking = min_rank(n)) |> 
  filter(n>10000) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, fill = aisle)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

- This table shows **the three most popular items in each of the
  aisles** “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
  vegetables fruits”.

``` r
instacart |> 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) |> 
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients" | aisle == "dog food care" | aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") |> 
  summarize(n = n()) |> 
  filter(min_rank(desc(n)) < 4) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |

| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |

- This table shows **the mean hour of the day** at which Pink Lady
  Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week.

``` r
instacart |> 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |> 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |> 
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream" ) |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |        4 |        5 |        6 |

## Problem 2

**1. Importing Data**

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

**2. Data cleaning:**

- Format the data to use appropriate variable names;

- Focus on the “Overall Health” topic;

- Include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”;

- Organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
  “Excellent”.

``` r
brfss_clean_df = 
  brfss_smart2010 |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") |> 
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) |> 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))
```

- In **2002**, states **`MA, NJ and PA`** were observed at 7 or more
  locations:

``` r
brfss_clean_df |> 
  filter(year==2002) |> 
  group_by(locationabbr) |> 
  distinct(locationdesc) |> 
  summarize(n = n())|> 
  filter(n>7) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 2
    ##   locationabbr     n
    ##   <chr>        <int>
    ## 1 MA               8
    ## 2 NJ               8
    ## 3 PA              10

- In **2010**, states
  **`CA, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, TX and WA`** were observed at 7
  or more locations:

``` r
brfss_clean_df |> 
  filter(year==2010) |> 
  group_by(locationabbr) |> 
  distinct(locationdesc) |> 
  summarize(n = n())|> 
  filter(n>7) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 11 × 2
    ##    locationabbr     n
    ##    <chr>        <int>
    ##  1 CA              12
    ##  2 FL              41
    ##  3 MA               9
    ##  4 MD              12
    ##  5 NC              12
    ##  6 NE              10
    ##  7 NJ              19
    ##  8 NY               9
    ##  9 OH               8
    ## 10 TX              16
    ## 11 WA              10

- **brfss_exce_df** dataset only includes Excellent responses, and
  contains year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
  across locations within a state.

``` r
brfss_exce_df =
  brfss_clean_df |> 
  filter(response == "Excellent") |> 
  select(c(year, locationabbr, locationdesc, data_value)) |> 
  group_by(locationabbr, year) |> 
  mutate(data_value_mean = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a state
  (that is, make a plot showing a line for each state across years – the
  geom_line geometry and group aesthetic will help).

``` r
brfss_exce_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = data_value_mean, group = locationabbr, color = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line() 
```

![](p8105_hw3_yc4384_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

- Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
  distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
  locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss_p_exce_df = 
  brfss_clean_df |> 
    filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Poor")) |> 
    filter(year %in% c(2006, 2010)) |> 
    filter(locationabbr == "NY") |> 
    select(c(year, locationabbr, locationdesc, data_value, response)) |> 
    group_by(locationabbr, year) 

brfss_p_exce_df |>   
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value, color = locationdesc)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ year)
```

## Problem 3

Accelerometers have become an appealing alternative to self-report
techniques for studying physical activity in observational studies and
clinical trials, largely because of their relative objectivity. During
observation periods, the devices can measure MIMS in a short period;
one-minute intervals are common. Because accelerometers can be worn
comfortably and unobtrusively, they produce around-the-clock
observations.

This problem uses accelerometer data collected on 250 participants in
the NHANES study. The participants’ demographic data can be downloaded
here, and their accelerometer data can be downloaded here. Variables
\*MIMS are the MIMS values for each minute of a 24-hour day starting at
midnight.

Load, tidy, merge, and otherwise organize the data sets. Your final
dataset should include all originally observed variables; exclude
participants less than 21 years of age, and those with missing
demographic data; and encode data with reasonable variable classes
(i.e. not numeric, and using factors with the ordering of tables and
plots in mind).

Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each
education category, and create a visualization of the age distributions
for men and women in each education category. Comment on these items.

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to
create a total activity variable for each participant. Plot these total
activities (y-axis) against age (x-axis); your plot should compare men
to women and have separate panels for each education level. Include a
trend line or a smooth to illustrate differences. Comment on your plot.

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each education level and use color to indicate sex. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph;
including smooth trends may help identify differences.
